      <h2>More about me</h2>
      <p>I'm a CS major, but I also have a minor in Sociology! I'm in various clubs, such 
          as Alpha Kappa Psi, Association for Computer Machinery, Tru Women in Computer Science, 
          and the Hispanic American Leadership Organization! I love to run and play the piano in 
          my free time, and I'm trying to teach myself how to cook!
