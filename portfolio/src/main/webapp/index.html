      <h1>Welcome to Elena Pelaez's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>This is my portfolio.</p>
      <p>
          I am a computer science major at Truman State University! I am originally from
            Kansas City, Missouri and I am super excited to work with the SPS program!

      <h2>More about me</h2>
      <p>I'm a CS major, but I also have a minor in Sociology! I'm in various clubs, such 
          as Alpha Kappa Psi, Association for Computer Machinery, Tru Women in Computer Science, 
          and the Hispanic American Leadership Organization! I love to run and play the piano in 
          my free time, and I'm trying to teach myself how to cook!
